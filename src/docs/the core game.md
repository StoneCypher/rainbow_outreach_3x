# The core game

Our goal is to deliver the same game three times over the next 12 months for Rainbow: once for `<Mermaids MotD`, once for `Winx Club` 20th anniversary, and once for `Winx Club` soft reboot.  If that goes well, we will develop a second distinct game style and deliver that twice more, for `Mermaids` and `Winx` reboot, respectively.

This document describes the first core game, but not the modifications that make its three variations distinct.  As such, reading only this document may inappropriately give the impression that we're delivering three cookie-cutter games.

We are not.

In the fashion that Mario, Bionic Commando, Metroid, Rogue Legacy, and Castlevania are all similar enough that co-implementing them with shared software would have value, but players will see them as majorly distinct games, this document describes the core game underlying the three named in the first run above.

These three are all what are commonly called `Survivors Roguelites`.  Earlier described by games like `Magic Survival` and `Robotron 2084`, survivors games are now commonly associated with `Vampire Survivors` and `Halls of Torment`.
