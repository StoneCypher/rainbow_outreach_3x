art requirements

# General

In general we need branding elements, such as logos.  It is helpful to have any art assets that are easy to transfer.

If there are any stylistic elements you would like to direct, we're ready to consume them.  By example, maybe you want the menus to be made of a particular material, or for a selection UI to resemble an element from an episode.  In general, we can accomodate that.

If there are any branding elements you would like to provide, such as font heirarchies, color palettes, negative space structures, imagery, iconography, or other look-and-feel elements, we're ready to support them.

Otherwise, we will draw such things from the shows independently.  (This will be challenging for Mermaids unless we can be provided episodes early.)

Character and monster animations, spells, weapons, and similar art is highly valued.

Character alternate designs that could be sold as Veblen goods would be valued.  Other outfits, other battle gear, even just a different shirt they wear one day, let us see it.

If you want us to use specific character looks from specific episodes, please identify the stated episodes.  Our game design includes selling alternative looks, so there's no reason to keep it to just one.

# Specific to classic Winx

Honestly, we would like you to provide as much as is convenient, but we can draw everything we need from the show, here.

If one particular prior game (not even necessarily a Winx game) seemed to "look good" to you, please let us know.  That will help us constrain our own choices to fit your preferences.

We are almost certain to develop this in 2d isometrics.  3d does not fit the time schedule allotted.

# Specific to reboot Winx

We would like character designs from at least four, helpfully eight, ideally nine perspectives (at least front, back, left, right; helpfully front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, ideally above.)

The same for any major characters villains you'd like worked in.  Presumably this will include some small subset of Valtor, Darkar, Queen Doranna, King Argan, Orion, Twinkly, the Lumen, the White Fox, King Sky, Brandon, Riven, Timmy, Helia, Nex, Obscurum, the Trix, the Star Dummies, Diaspro, or the Shaman Witch.

We need to know what Cosmix looks like.  We need to know what new Sirenix and Enchantix look like, and if the old appearances are gone.

We need backdrops for Lumenia, Prometia, and contemporary shots of Andros, Earth, Domino, Lynphea, and Melody.

We need to know if the game should follow the series or be a side story.  If it's a side story, we need to know if we can use the unused characters (the way the comic is using Roxy, who appears to be gone from the reboot.)

We would like to use updated logos and branding elements.

We wonder about access to voice actors.

# Specific to Mermaids MotD

We genuinely don't know a whole lot about this series.  Being able to watch an episode would probably help a whole lot.  Any textual description of motifs would be gladly consumed.

Because there is no media to draw from, we need a full panopoly for this show, or the right to make our own stuff (probably would rather not do this very much.)

This means:

* 4- or 8-points for any character or monster to be included
    * Internal character design documents talking about style and personality would also help
* Any branding we can get our hands on of any kind
* Any backdrops or locales that we can adapt into level art
* Color palettes, especially by location
* Weapons and items that may be in use
* Spells that may be in use by either side
* Iconography that you'd like us to use for achievements if applicable (we'll make these happily)
