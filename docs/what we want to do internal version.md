# The making of games

`This is the INTERNAL version, and says things that the outside shouldn't see.`

So the ideal plan is as follows.

1. We pitch 3-ish publishers *today*.  We say "hi, we're about to get a license from an established cartoon brand.  We have a game we're already developing, and they want a variant for them.  We'd like to get a publisher for our first game, to hire into the second game, and whoever publishes our first game gets first look at the cartoon associated game.  We're hoping to move fast.  The games are `Survivors` games aimed at the female market, some 7-11 and some nostalgia for the long running series, 18-35.  Our existing game has about a year long development timeline remaining.  May we discuss?"
    * We can accept this way three times, because we're going to get more than one license from Rainbow.
2. We get the license to make three games for Rainbow.  This means we're ready to publish three pair of games, through three distinct publishers.  We also gain approx $2 million war chest for the private games.  We gain ***at least*** another 2 million for the Rainbow games, but probably double that.
3. I hire 10-ish engineers.  People are asking me for work right now; this is do-able.
    * We create the core game as a single team.
    * We split into two teams and charge to make two short timeline license games.  We deliver these games first.
    * We recombine to make the Winx reboot game.  We deliver this next.
    * We split into three teams to make the three remaining for-us games, and deliver these at leisure.
4. If Rainbow is happy, we develop a `Deckbuilding roguelike` core and deliver two of those as well.
5. We begin to reach out to other cartoon license holders to see if they want their games dispatched.
